	abstract = {Neuroinflammation is one of the key components contributing to the devastating outcome of ischemic stroke. Starting with stroke onset, inflammatory processes contribute both to cell damage and tissue remodeling. The early release of alarmins triggers the upregulation of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in the compromised integrity of the blood–brain barrier. From this moment on, the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, reactive gliosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) alterations become intricately intertwined and act as one unit during the tissue remodeling. While the mechanisms of leukocyte and glia activation are amply reviewed, the field of ECM modification remains as yet under explored. In this review, we focus on the interplay between neuroinflammatory cascades and ECM in the ischemic brain. By summarizing the currently available evidence obtained by in vitro research, animal experimentation and human studies, we aim to propose a new direction for the future investigation of stroke recovery.},

  abstract={Despite the crucial role of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in neural plasticity and neurological disorders, their ultrastructural organization remains largely unresolved. We have developed a novel approach combining superresolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) and mathematical reconstruction that allows for quantitative analysis of PNN topology. Since perineuronal matrix is capable to restrict neural plasticity but at the same time is necessary to maintain synapses, we hypothesized that a beneficial post stroke recovery requires a reversible loosening of PNNs. Our results indicated that focal cerebral ischemia induces partial depletion of PNNs and that mild hypoperfusion not associated with ischemic injury can induce ultra-structural rearrangements in visually intact meshworks. In line with the activation of neural plasticity under mild stress stimuli, we provide evidence that topological conversion of PNNs can support post stroke neural rewiring.},
