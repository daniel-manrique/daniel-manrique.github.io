	abstract = {Neuroinflammation is one of the key components contributing to the devastating outcome of ischemic stroke. Starting with stroke onset, inflammatory processes contribute both to cell damage and tissue remodeling. The early release of alarmins triggers the upregulation of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in the compromised integrity of the blood–brain barrier. From this moment on, the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, reactive gliosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) alterations become intricately intertwined and act as one unit during the tissue remodeling. While the mechanisms of leukocyte and glia activation are amply reviewed, the field of ECM modification remains as yet under explored. In this review, we focus on the interplay between neuroinflammatory cascades and ECM in the ischemic brain. By summarizing the currently available evidence obtained by in vitro research, animal experimentation and human studies, we aim to propose a new direction for the future investigation of stroke recovery.},

	abstract = {Glial scar formation represents a fundamental response to central nervous system (CNS) injury. It is mainly characterized by a well-defined spatial rearrangement of reactive astrocytes and microglia. The mechanisms underlying glial scar formation have been extensively studied, yet quantitative descriptors of the spatial arrangement of reactive glial cells remain limited. Here, we present a novel approach using point pattern analysis (PPA) and topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify spatial patterns of reactive glial cells after experimental ischemic stroke in mice. We provide open and reproducible tools using R and Julia to quantify spatial intensity, cell covariance and conditional distribution, cell-to-cell interactions, and short/long-scale arrangement, which collectively disentangle the arrangement patterns of the glial scar. This approach unravels a substantial divergence in the distribution of reactive astrocytes and microglia after injury that conventional analysis methods cannot fully characterize. PPA and TDA are valuable tools for studying the complex spatial arrangement of reactive glia and other nervous cells following CNS injuries and have potential applications for evaluating glial-targeted restorative therapies.},

  abstract={Despite the crucial role of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in neural plasticity and neurological disorders, their ultrastructural organization remains largely unresolved. We have developed a novel approach combining superresolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) and mathematical reconstruction that allows for quantitative analysis of PNN topology. Since perineuronal matrix is capable to restrict neural plasticity but at the same time is necessary to maintain synapses, we hypothesized that a beneficial post stroke recovery requires a reversible loosening of PNNs. Our results indicated that focal cerebral ischemia induces partial depletion of PNNs and that mild hypoperfusion not associated with ischemic injury can induce ultra-structural rearrangements in visually intact meshworks. In line with the activation of neural plasticity under mild stress stimuli, we provide evidence that topological conversion of PNNs can support post stroke neural rewiring.},

	abstract = {Cellular responses in glia play a key role in regulating brain remodeling post-stroke. However, excessive glial reactivity impedes post-ischemic neuroplasticity and hampers neurological recovery. While damage-associated molecular patterns and activated microglia were shown to induce astrogliosis, the molecules that restrain astrogliosis are largely unknown. We explored the role of tenascin-C (TnC), an extracellular matrix component involved in wound healing and remodeling of injured tissues, in mice exposed to ischemic stroke induced by transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the healthy adult brain, TnC expression is restricted to neurogenic stem cell niches. We previously reported that TnC is upregulated in ischemic brain lesions. We herein show that the de novo expression of TnC post-stroke is closely associated with reactive astrocytes, and that astrocyte reactivity at 14 days post-ischemia is increased in TnC-deficient mice (TnC−/−). By analyzing the three-dimensional morphology of astrocytes in previously ischemic brain tissue, we revealed that TnC−/− reduces astrocytic territorial volume, branching point number, and branch length, which are presumably hallmarks of the homeostatic regulatory astrocyte state, in the post-acute stroke phase after 42 days. Interestingly, TnC−/− moderately increased aggrecan, a neuroplasticity-inhibiting proteoglycan, in the ischemic brain tissue at 42 days post-ischemia. In vitro in astrocyte-microglia cocultures, we showed that TnC−/− reduces the microglial migration speed on astrocytes and elevates intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression. Post-stroke, TnC−/− did not alter the ischemic lesion size or neurological recovery, however microglia-associated ICAM1 was upregulated in TnC−/− mice during the first week post stroke. Our data suggest that TnC plays a central role in restraining post-ischemic astrogliosis and regulating astrocyte-microglial interactions.},

Tissue scarring upon cerebral ischemia entails a cascade of multifaceted cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the remodeling of the neurovascular unit, which integrates neuronal, glial, and vascular functions.\&nbsp; The process encompasses inflammation, glial reactivity, vascular reactivity, and neuronal remodeling. In this chapter we cover three major aspects involved in tissue scarring after cerebral ischemia. First, we outline the primary cellular mechanisms underlying glial scar formation, emphasizing on the interactions between astrocytes, microglia, and mural cells, including pericytes and fibroblasts at the injury core and perilesional areas. Next, we address the key routes of extracellular matrix deposition by reactive and fibrogenic cells, including proteoglycans, tenascins, fibronectin, and collagen. Finally, we discuss the promises and challenges of manipulating tissue scarring as a strategy to promote brain structural remodeling and neurological recovery.},

	abstract = {Vascular dementia (VaD) constitutes the second most prevalent cause of dementia in the world after Alzheimer’s disease (AD). VaD regroups heterogeneous neurological conditions in which the decline of cognitive functions, including executive functions, is associated with structural and functional alterations in the cerebral vasculature. Among these cerebrovascular disorders, major stroke, and cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) constitute the major risk factors for VaD. These conditions alter neurovascular functions leading to blood-brain barrier (BBB) deregulation, neurovascular coupling dysfunction, and inflammation. Accumulation of neurovascular impairments over time underlies the cognitive function decline associated with VaD. Furthermore, several vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes have been shown to exacerbate neurovascular impairments and thus increase VaD prevalence. Importantly, air pollution constitutes an underestimated risk factor that triggers vascular dysfunction via inflammation and oxidative stress. The review summarizes the current knowledge related to the pathological mechanisms linking neurovascular impairments associated with stroke, cSVD, and vascular risk factors with a particular emphasis on air pollution, to VaD etiology and progression. Furthermore, the review discusses the major challenges to fully elucidate the pathobiology of VaD, as well as research directions to outline new therapeutic interventions.},
