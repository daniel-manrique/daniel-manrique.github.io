Egor Dzyubenko studied biology, biophysics and bionanotechnology at Lomonosov’s Moscow State University and received his diploma in 2011. His diploma thesis focussed on the dynamics of mitochondrial membrane potential during hyperglycaemic stress in cultivated neurons. He performed his PhD thesis at the Department of Cell Morphology and Molecular Neurobiology of the Ruhr University Bochum under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Andreas Faissner from 2012 until 2016. His thesis entitled ‘Modifying synaptogenesis and functional state of neural networks in vitro: insights from antipsychotic treatments and extracellular matrix depletion’ was awarded with the grade “with distinction”. Subsequently, he moved to the University Hospital Essen and joined the NeuroScienceLab within the Chair of Vascular Neurology, Dementia and Ageing Research in 2017.
