Dhananjay Bhaskar is a postdoctoral research associate at Yale University and a Yale – Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow. He earned his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering and Sc.M. in Data Science from Brown University in 2021 with a dissertation on topological data analysis of collective motion.

Dhananjay’s interests reside at the intersection of mathematical modeling, computational biology, and machine learning. Specifically, my recent work includes: (1) Developing generative models for small molecule and antibody therapeutics, (2) Quantitative analysis of spatiotemporal signaling through the lens of geometric deep learning and topological data analysis, (3) Learning dynamics and inferring regulatory networks (genes and neurons) using graph attention and neural ODE models.
