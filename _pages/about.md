I am a neuroscientist focused on understanding glial reactivity following brain injury. While doing my doctoral studies at the [International Graduate School of Neuroscience](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/igsn/) at the Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, I realized that traditional analysis methodologies were not suitable to solve my research questions. Thus, I started to educate myself in statistical modeling using probabilistic approaches (Bayesian statistics) and developed a strong data science-based perspective. My current interests lies in unraveling the intricacies of brain scarring and recovery. I leverage a blend of modeling-based data analysis, machine learning, and image processing to dissect these complex processes.

In addition, my foray into data analysis has led to the development of unbiased, automated image analysis techniques using Python and machine learning. These [approaches](https://medium.com/@damanrique) are particularly beneficial for researchers grappling with traditional, manual cell counting methods.

Finally, I am an ardent advocate for open and reproducible science. I firmly believe this approach is essential for maintaining quality control in scientific literature and ensuring effective oversight of scientific outputs.
