With TDA, the user can evaluate the degree of noise, variability, and complexity, as well as identifying topological features such as holes, loops, and voids in the point clouds at different scales. This approach is based on tools like vietoris-rips complexes and persistent homology that allow to visualize complex topological structures.</p> <p>&lt;/div&gt;</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/TDAimg-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/TDAimg-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/TDAimg-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/TDAimg.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Example of Vietoris-Rips complexes. </div> <p>A first approach is available in this <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.04.560910v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">prepint</a> and its corresponding <a href="https://github.com/daniel-manrique/Stroke_GlialScar_PPA-TDA" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">repository</a>.
