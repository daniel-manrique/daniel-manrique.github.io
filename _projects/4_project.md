As a neuroscientist, I am focused on understanding glial reactivity after brain injury. I am particularly interested in astrocytes and their derived extracellular matrix molecules. Recently, I have ventured into the study of PDGFR-B cells and their contribution to fibrotic scar.

## Resources

The following are research/resources I have been involved:

### Research articles and book chapters

  - **In progress**: I am writing  popular science book on astrocytes. I hope to finish it soon.
  
  - My [research article](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.04.560910v1) applying Point pattern analysis (PPA) and Topological data analysis (TDA) for the examination of glial scar formation.
  
  - My [research article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0945053X22000555) showing that tenascinc-C (TnC) restrict astrologists following brain injury.
  
  - In this [book chapter](https://exonpublications.com/index.php/exon/article/view/cerebral-ischemia-neurovascular-reactivity) I summarize the different phases of glial reactivity and how it contributies to glial/fibrotic scar formation.
  
  - My [research article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0945053X22000555) showing that tenascinc-C (TnC) modulates the infiltration of immune T-cells.
  
  - My [review](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1756286418818092) showing how the extracelular matrix contributes to brain remodeling following injury.
  
### Datasets

  - This [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/8399976) contains microscopy images of Gfap (astrocytes) Iba1 (microglia) and NeuN (Neurons) following cerebral ischemia.The repository also contains the point patterns analyzed in [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.04.560910v1) research artcle.
