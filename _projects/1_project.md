I am exploring ways to incorporate Point patterns analysis (PPA) for the analysis of microscopy images in neuroscience. This allows investigation the spatial arrangement of cells like neurons and neuroglia in healthy and disease conditions. To achieve this goal I meanly implement to spatstat package in R-programming language.
